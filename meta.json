Mandi has a lot more free electives credits than ropar in the course which you can choose according to your liking.\n2. \u2060Ropar\u2019s curriculum has lot more generic and non-core courses like geography and environmental science even till their sixth semester which, honestly, prove out to be useless. On the other hand, Mandi\u2019s curriculum offers more branch specific courses from 1st year itself which are more industry-oriented.\n3. Important \u2060Courses like Machine Learning and Data Structures are offered in the initial years of study contrary to Ropar where these courses are offered in 3rd year of Study.\nConsider these points before making any choice if academics and placements matter to you.\n06/06/2025, 12:27 - Arihant IITM Cse: itna toh apne liye nahi dekha tha meine last year\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n06/06/2025, 12:28 - Sameer Allen: same bhai \ud83d\ude2d! main toh pahad dekh k hi chala aaya tha\n06/06/2025, 12:28 - Arihant IITM Cse: sameee\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n06/06/2025, 12:28 - Sameer Allen: bacho ko toh samhana padega na. yeh khud research krne ka try nhi krte h \ud83d\ude14\n06/06/2025, 12:29 - Arihant IITM Cse: fir bhi wapis same doubt puchenge\ud83d\ude02\n06/06/2025, 12:29 - Sameer Allen: \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\n06/06/2025, 12:30 - +91 77353 02365: Pichle saal aise counseling grps the?\n06/06/2025, 12:30 - Arihant IITM Cse: yup\n06/06/2025, 12:30 - Sameer Allen: haan\n06/06/2025, 12:30 - +91 77353 02365: \ud83d\udc80\n06/06/2025, 12:30 - +91 77353 02365: Tum logo ne use kiya tha?\n06/06/2025, 12:31 - Sameer Allen: haan\n06/06/2025, 12:31 - Arihant IITM Cse: haa obv\n06/06/2025, 12:31 - Sameer Allen: \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\n06/06/2025, 12:44 - +91 96115 75060: From which sem can you pick electives?\n06/06/2025, 12:44 - +91 72180 39734: Genrally from 3rd\n06/06/2025, 12:45 - Sameer Allen: in iit mandi u can pick free electives from 3rd sem"

IIT Mandi \u2013 Bioengineering\nPros:\nUpcoming interdisciplinary field (bio + tech).\nMandi is improving rapidly; good infrastructure and exposure.\nResearch-focused institute; decent global opportunities.\nCoding electives are possible (especially in 2nd year onwards).\nCons:\nLess core jobs in India currently.\nYou\u2019ll need to switch to coding or go abroad for better placements if not interested in biotech core.\nBest for: Someone open to research, coding, or switching to interdisciplinary tech (bioinformatics, AI in healthcare).\n---\n\ud83d\udc8a 2. IIT BHU \u2013 Pharmaceutical Engineering\nPros:\nOld, reputed IIT; very good alumni network.\nOption to shift career paths via coding or analytics if needed.\nStrong in pharma core (good for MS/PhD or jobs like DRDO, pharma companies).\nCons:\nLimited core jobs unless you aim for pharma R&D or higher studies.\nHeavy chemistry/chemical engineering base\u2014can be dry if you're not interested."

Because civil i will get most probably1.Modern curriculum aligned with the future\nIIT Mandi\u2019s EE curriculum is genuinely future-focused. Courses like FDP (Freedom of Design Practicum), DP (Design Practicum), and three separate, in-depth Data Science courses make the learning practical and relevant. We also have electives in Machine Learning and Deep Learning that are available as free electives, so even core EE students can comfortably dive into modern domains. 2.Modern infrastructure and cutting-edge labs\nAt Mandi, seniors and professors are quite approachable. UG students here don\u2019t just do research for namesake \u2014 many have actually published research papers while still in their BTech. That kind of early exposure is a huge boost whether you\u2019re planning for MS, PhD, or research-based internships like DAAD or MITACS. 4.Flexible and open course structure\nYou\u2019re not bound by a rigid syllabus. The EE department allows you to customize your path \u2014 whether it\u2019s focusing on Embedded Systems, VLSI, Power, or even choosing CSE electives. You can even officially pursue a minor in CSE which opens up even more options in AI/ML, software, or research fields.,5.Hackathon culture and highly active clubs\nWe have a lot of hackathons, not just basic ones but those conducted by companies that are part of the Inter-IIT ecosystem. This keeps the competitive and building spirit alive. On top of that, our technical clubs \u2014 whether it's robotics, aeromodelling, coding, or E-cell \u2014 are genuinely active, organizing events almost every other week. It\u2019s the kind of place where you always have something to work on or learn from. 6.Beautiful campus with fewer distractions\n05/06/25, 8:23\u202fpm - You created group \"Bioengineering Info 25\"\n05/06/25, 8:25\u202fpm - Devansh: @919501006994 add krde community me\n05/06/25, 8:25\u202fpm - Join other topic-based groups in this community and get admin announcements\nAnyone in the community can join this group"

Because civil i will get most probably1.Modern curriculum aligned with the future\nIIT Mandi\u2019s EE curriculum is genuinely future-focused. Courses like FDP (Freedom of Design Practicum), DP (Design Practicum), and three separate, in-depth Data Science courses make the learning practical and relevant. We also have electives in Machine Learning and Deep Learning that are available as free electives, so even core EE students can comfortably dive into modern domains. 2.Modern infrastructure and cutting-edge labs\nAt Mandi, seniors and professors are quite approachable. UG students here don\u2019t just do research for namesake \u2014 many have actually published research papers while still in their BTech. That kind of early exposure is a huge boost whether you\u2019re planning for MS, PhD, or research-based internships like DAAD or MITACS. 4.Flexible and open course structure\nYou\u2019re not bound by a rigid syllabus. The EE department allows you to customize your path \u2014 whether it\u2019s focusing on Embedded Systems, VLSI, Power, or even choosing CSE electives. You can even officially pursue a minor in CSE which opens up even more options in AI/ML, software, or research fields.,5.Hackathon culture and highly active clubs\nWe have a lot of hackathons, not just basic ones but those conducted by companies that are part of the Inter-IIT ecosystem. This keeps the competitive and building spirit alive. On top of that, our technical clubs \u2014 whether it's robotics, aeromodelling, coding, or E-cell \u2014 are genuinely active, organizing events almost every other week. It\u2019s the kind of place where you always have something to work on or learn from. 6.Beautiful campus with fewer distractions\n05/06/25, 8:23\u202fpm - You created group \"Bioengineering Info 25\"\n05/06/25, 8:25\u202fpm - Devansh: @919501006994 add krde community me\n05/06/25, 8:25\u202fpm - Join other topic-based groups in this community and get admin announcements\nAnyone in the community can join this group\nYour profile is visible to admins\n06/06/25, 11:06\u202fam - +91 88882 30405: Hi\n06/06/25, 11:06\u202fam - +91 88882 30405: Does it have scope in core\n06/06/25, 11:06\u202fam - +91 88882 30405: I want to do upse can i do\n06/06/25, 11:07\u202fam - +91 88882 30405: Branch is hectic will i get time for upse\n06/06/25, 11:07\u202fam - +91 88882 30405: Is I failed in upse then does I get placement from core min 1 lac per month\n06/06/25, 11:17\u202fam - madhav: Branch is not at all hectic.
